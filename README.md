Thank you so much for meeting with us. As discussed, see below the frontend engineering challenge.

The Rawson Properties team is cooking up a new project, and we would like your assistance with it! Please go through the requirements below to start our exciting technical frontend engineering challenge. The link to the XD design is attached below.

Good luck and enjoy!

Requirements:

You have been tasked to build the page presented on the XD file using either Vue or React. As a frontend engineer, you have been given the freedom to decide how best to execute on this task. The only thing that is asked of you is the following:

- Clone this repository, then create your own public repository and set that as the remote (see: git remote set-url). - This is so that other's can't see your work as they would if you were to fork the repository.
- Create a pull request to the main branch of your repository with your solution.
- Use Vite (https://vitejs.dev/) to bootstrap the project.
- See to it that the page is componentized. Meaning that anything that could potentially be reused on another project, is extracted to it's own component. **Please note that the number of items that should be componentized is at your own discretion**.
- Commit often, and write great commit messages. See this article before you start: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-use-commitlint-to-write-good-commit-messages/
- Make sure that the table is sortable and searchable.
- Use bootstrap and bootstrap icons for styling.


Not required:
- Exact color swatches. Use your own.
- Pagination
- Responsiveness
- Backend - Use a simple .json file
- Create New Valuation functionality - The button ONLY should suffice. 

Last notes:
- Please contact me on Offerzen if you have any further questions. I am more than happy to help.
- Please take your time, but I would ideally like this test completed within 5 days (excluding weekends).

All the best,
Elvis Magagula
